      <h2>CMU Project</h2>
      <p><a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/floralWhiteDog0297">CMU Project Link</a></p>
      <p>This project was a project where I had built a game that had you defeat balloons before it reached the cannons. I accomplished it through the use of the CMU Academy coding. It helped me learn the sophistication of coding and how complex it could get. Although it did take awhile to create, it was a fun experience to achieve with coding.</p>

      <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?username=tnajarro&projectname=Drive%20Chauffeur">Driving Chaffeur Project Link</a></p>
      <p>This project was a project for the Congressional App Challenge. Me and my partner would spend a bunch of time on this, planning each of the sprites and what the app would do. This app would teach people the basics of driving, allowing them to go through lessons and do a test drive.</p>

      <h2>Snowflake Project</h2>
      <p>This was a project where we had to create a pattern using the code. We accomplished it by using the pinwheel branches to create this effect. We did struggle with creating the color pattern in the image, but it was solved through the way the “change crayon ____” block worked.</p>

      <h2>Sharpen Project</h2>
      <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?username=tnajarro&projectname=Sharpen">Sharpen Project Link</a></p>
      <p>This project was a project for the AP Create Task made on Snap. This app would test peoples brain and motor skills in a multitude of games.Some of these games would range from: Aim Pop, a point and click game, Type Racer, a typing test game, and Cave Memory, a memorization game. With all these games, the app was practically three apps in one, with a bunch of different pixel art sprites. I honestly could've made an app with just one game but it's too late.</p>
