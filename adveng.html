      <p>This project is a keychain of my name made in Fusion 360. It is one of the first things I have made with using Fusion 360. We made it by following a drawing that was made. It is customized so it has my name instead of another name.</p>

      <h2>Spongebob Train Project (2023)</h2>
      <p>This project was a pretty long one. Our team's goal was to create a full train, with each of the train cars being made individually by us. The train cars all needed to have 3 different colors each, and needed to match the size to fit a Thomas-the-Train-like rail. My team decided to base our trains on Spongebob, and I decided to do the Krusty Krab as the locomotive. When we began, we started with a simple prototype of the car to get the feeling of what it might be. For me, my prototype needed changes that dealt with sizes of holes in the model. After, we redesigned everything to the point that it is now. This project essencially showed me how to apply the skills of Fusion 360 to actual models, and it also showed me the taxing design process.</p>

        <h2>Lightsaber Project (2024)</h2>
        <p>This project was a inclass project where we designed electronics and the engineering of the lightsaber itself. This was pretty much all on our own with each part of the lightsaber divided among our table group. I would do the electronics while my other tablemate(s) would do the engineering. Tons of the parts would come apart on the last day of the project, but we were able to showcase a functioning lightsaber. </p>

        <h2>Air-Hockey Machine Project (2024)</h2>
        <p>This project was one passed down to us from previous classes. We had inherited the basic design of the project and it was our job to improve it. Like the last project, the project was divided among my new tablemates, where I would do the electronics once more. I had coded and put together the air hockey machine so that it actually worked. By the time we finished the project, we got it somewhat working with some lighting issues.</p>

        <h2>AP Calculus Capstone Project (2024)</h2>
        <p>This project was a project where I conducted a research project to determine what exactly makes a car faster in movement. The engineering part of this project was designing multiple different car parts and comparing the speeds of each of the parts</p>
